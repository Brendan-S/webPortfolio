                For this project I was tasked with creating a printed piece 
                that reveales a hidden aspect of itself. An additional constraint
                plased upon me was to utalise a risograph printer. My goal when designing
                the piece was to induce a slower pace of reading. On one side are photographs 
                of me that that unfold in an uncanny manner. This causes the viewer 
                to slow down and read the object at a slower pace due to the 
                disorienting layout.<!--  As a result of the slower pace, the viwer is able 
                to stop and pause on each panel for much longer than if the layout 
                was more straight forward and generic. The color of the piece was picked for 
                its intensity and vaibrant qualities compared to the other printer 
                inks I had tested.    -->
