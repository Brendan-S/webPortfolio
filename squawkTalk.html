                Squawk Talk is a self intiated podcast I created with 
                a friend. We both wanted to talk about topics in relationd
                to art school, and more sepcifically, to our classes. We recorded 
                each session once a week and eventually came out with a 
                series! <br><br>

                During my research stage I found many podcast websites tended to follow a similar layout.
                I planned for the layout to draw the user into the main 
                content of the site, the episodes, while remaining fresh

                <!-- My overall goals for designing the website was to make it both
                fun and surprizing. These goals were developed in response to 
                the reaserch I had done on exhisting podcast websites.
