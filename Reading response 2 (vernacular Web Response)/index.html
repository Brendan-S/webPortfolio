                <p class="one">In her visual essay she describes the differences between the old web and the new web. When I first visited her page I was struck by its layout. Its pure html with bits of gifs/widgets of the old web. For the response I wanted to talk about the difference between old and new. I decided to break up the layout into two large sections to represent the values she mentions embody the spirit of the old web and the values we now cherish today on the new web. I decided to make the left container the old web and the right container the new web. As we read left to right I thought this subtle decision to could imply the passage of time as well. In the old web the composition is much more colorful/interactive. Elements are scattered and their reaction to input is not necessarily known to the user. On the left everything has been organized by an internal grid system. Users can navigate through the space much more intuitively through the grid layout and its composition. I attempted to make the color choice much more restrictive/restrained since modern websites really only use several colors, those of their brand. </p>
                <p class= "two">Lialina's essay is drenched in nostalgia. Her longing for the old web's freedom is greatly expressed. She recounts how one had the ability to create almost anything out of their custom webpage. The old web was a land for the free. It was very the much the digital sister of the wild west. As such the majority of the creators/users on the web at that time were amateurs with little to no experience in design. It was when the regulatory efforts of the government stepped in that rules and best practices were developed. Since then the web has ceased to be a place of infinite expression. Now users are driven to common thresholds by social media platforms. There's a niche for every hobby/practice. </p>
                <p class="two-two">From Lialina's essay she explains her own experience's that shaped her view of the modern web. The old web also used to be a place of constant sharing. Collaboration and commitment were common place. Novelty items such as the "site under construction" were abundant on every site. It's presence signaled that someone was constantly working and constantly caring. Through the web's constant maintenance there was gratification given to those who looked out for one another. </p>

                                                        Lialina describes the new web as one that is sleek. Its contents belie its genetic make-up. Ironically called markup, html is the foundation upon which all modern websites are created. Like most parts of the contemporary web, html is a standard settled upon. Through its widespread use the language is everywhere. Many of the web's integral functions were also settled upon, not by commerce or by sanction but by common-place practices made standard. For example the use of hyperlinks were intended for people to actively cross-reference source material, that was being referenced in multiple web pages or browsers.  
                                                    </p>
                                                </div>

                                                <div class="paragraph2">
                                                    <p>
                                                        But now instead, hyperlinks serve as pathways that funnel users from one page to the next. This act of leaving one portion of content behind for another is in opposition to the original intention of hyperlinks. As Lialina notes, the contemporary web has evolved not necessarily in the interest of the consumer. Unfortunately the web's newest functions are often built with the intention of collection, or archivism in the interest of companies. Through their collection of data, website's features are built upon and revised continuously. The web is in permanent flux. There is no "end" or real product line. Instead the business of developing the web heavily involves categorizing and packaging unique personalities gathered by usage data. Through this act of collection website managers can more accurately package and create new functions for their digital products. However, unlike the old web which was loud and boisterous in its collection methodology, the new web attempts to collect silently and out of sight. It is not uncommon for websites to track and store location data through one's I.P. address. The old web also featured a sense of global nicheness. One could find and reference small group forums for the simple pleasure of conversation. In the contemporary web space such activities are still common, but only on smaller websites. While social media sites attempt to recreate this sense of community, one is always overshadowed by the parent umbrella company. By accessing such sites one is eternally confined to their terms and agreements, most of which are left vague.

                                                    <p>It is the web's interconnectivity that is its strength. The internet boasts a range of interconnectivity unheard of or unseen in previous generations. However such interconnectivity is heavily monitored. Contrary to popular opinion the contemporary web is not a free range space. All website domains must be registered through a government owned company situated in the United States.  By itself, this alone grants the United States unreasonable amount of power across global internet channels. Theoretically the United States has the ability to decide what is legitimate and what is not directly through its access to domain registration. Even more so, the majority of internet sites visited by the global public are owned and housed in the United States. Culturally this directs the flow of traffic mainly to U.S. owned corporations. As such the web primarily serves the interest of the United States and not other democratic countries. It is unlikely that the United States would rescind such an amass of power and influence over the world's various cultures.
