                I was tasked with creating a website that
                actively moniters its enviornment, and reacts based on sensory input.
                For this website I designed it so it would actively use the microphone
                and respond to audio input. As the volume increases in scale, the dot
                moves left and also changes color. The higher the volume, the lighter 
                shade of grey the dot will have, and the more eratic its movement will become. 
                <!-- The different circles on display move using sign and co-sign functions 
                that allow the circle to orbit in a fixed radius. This project 
                introduced me to javascript and its many functionalities on the web.  -->
