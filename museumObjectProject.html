                For this project I was tasked with bringing a famouse piece of 
                art into the digital realm. The goal was to juxtapose traditional
                ways of artmaking with the interactive elements on the web. 
                I chose a still life by Georges Braque as my case study. During 
                the project <br>I made my own still life inspired by Braque's painting. 
                Then, I digitized pieces of my original still life and put them in motion. 
                The project as a whole utalizes the internet's capacity for movement. As such 
                the painting is in a perpetual state of motion so long as the user
                is viewing the webpage.
